## About Me
I'm  a computing student passionate about building practical software projects and exploring the technologies that drive them. Some of my recent work includes:
* A N<sup>th</sup> term Fibonacci Finder - implemented using matrix exponentiation (<a href="https://github.com/AH11037/fibonacciFAST">See Here</a>)
* A unit converter web app - converts units quickly in your browser (<a href="https://github.com/AH11037/UnitConverter">See Here</a>)
* A CLI task tracker - manage your daily tasks directly from the terminal (<a href = "https://github.com/AH11037/TaskTrackerCli">See Here</a>)
* And many more smaller projects exploring other concepts
I love problem-solving, building interactive tools, and experimenting with new technologies.
